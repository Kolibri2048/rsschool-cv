 ####  About me
4 years ago I went to study at a university in Poland. I chose an IT specialty. I reached the 3rd year, but due to a difficult situation, I had to drop out of school in order to recover after a while in the last semester. I studied programming at university. It was mostly C#, but there were other languages, although they were taught superficially. In the 3rd year, I got acquainted with Internet development.  Now I want to finish the RsSchool courses in order to continue working as a Front end, and maybe more as a full stack developer. But I have a lot to learn, including English, it's at A2 level, as you know, it's not enough :)

## Code example:

**Kata 6 Data Reverse.**
We received an array of segments that had a length of 8 bits. It was necessary to return a segment of these bits in the opposite direction
```
function dataReverse(data) {
  const reversed = [];
  for (let i = 0; i < data.length; i += 8) {
    const segment = data.slice(i, i + 8);
    reversed.unshift(...segment);
  }
  return reversed;
}
```
